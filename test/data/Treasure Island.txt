 | notes    = '''''Treasure Island''' is an adventure novel narrating a tale of "buccaneers and buried gold". First published as a book in 1883, it was originally serialised in the children's magazine ''Young Folks'' between 1881-82 under the title "The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island".''

''Traditionally considered a [[w:Bildungsroman|coming of age story]], it is an adventure tale of superb atmosphere, character and action, and also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality—as seen in Long John Silver—unusual for children's literature then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of all novels, and its influence on popular lore about pirates can not be overestimated.''
