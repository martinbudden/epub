<i>Child of the pure unclouded brow <br>
And dreaming eyes of wonder! <br>
Though time be fleet, and I and thou <br>
Are half a life asunder, <br>
Thy loving smile will surely hail <br>
The love-gift of a fairy-tale.

I have not seen thy sunny face, <br>
Nor heard thy silver laughter: <br>
No thought of me shall find a place <br>
In thy young life’s hereafter— <br>
Enough that now thou wilt not fail <br>
To listen to my fairy-tale.

A tale begun in other days, <br>
When summer suns were glowing— <br>
A simple chime, that served in time <br>
The rhythm of our rowing— <br>
Whose echoes live in memory yet, <br>
Though envious years would say “forget”.

Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread, <br>
With bitter tidings laden, <br>
Shall summon to unwelcome bed <br>
A melancholy maiden! <br>
We are but older children, dear, <br>
Who fret to find our bedtime near.

Without, the frost, the blinding snow, <br>
The storm-wind’s moody madness— <br>
Within, the firelight’s ruddy glow, <br>
And childhood’s nest of gladness. <br>
The magic words shall hold thee fast: <br>
Thou shalt not heed the raving blast.

And, though the shadow of a sigh <br>
May tremble through the story, <br>
For “happy summer days” gone by, <br>
And vanish’d summer glory— <br>
It shall not touch with breath of bale, <br>
The pleasance of our fairy-tale.</i>
